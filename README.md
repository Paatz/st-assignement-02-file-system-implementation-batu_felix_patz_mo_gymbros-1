# File Systems Implementation
## Own Approach

### Assignment
Write down things to be done when to implement a file / a directory.
Take into account that you have only the operations ReadBlock() and WriteBlock() on the disk.

### Required Tasks
- What has to be done, when creating a file foo.txt?
- What has to be done, when the file size has to be increased? Especially take care if it needs additional blocks
- What has to be done if a file is read sequentially?
- What has to be done if you want to access foo.txt randomly (seek())? 
- What has to be done when the file size decreases? Especially take care if it needs fewer blocks
- What has to be done when a file is deleted?

### Procedure
1. Make teams of 4
1. Accept the assignment (group assignemnt) and give your group a name having the last name of all team mates.
1. Create a directory named <your_last_name>.md (e.g. `bauer`).
1. Create a markdown file named <your_last_name>.md (e.g., `bauer.md`) and store it in your directory.
1. Jot down your ideas quickly (30 minutes). You may also do drawings and store them in your directory.
1. Commit your files, pull, push.
1. Open the files of your team mates and add remarks. Call a mate if yoir don't understand things (max. 5 minutes for each).
1. Pull push.
1. Join your team mates in a voice channel and discuss your ideas. Agree on a common solution and write it down in a new file (`final_solution/final_solution.md`).
1. Push
